# Forecasting-and-modelling-with-Excel-dataset
## This project developed a reliable oil import forecasting and modelling system using statistical and time series methods. Experimented with different forecasting techniques such as SMA, Experimental Smoothing, Naïve forecasting, and Linear Regression. and identified the most accurate model for predicting future oil imports. From the modelling and forecasting conducted using various techniques, the Moving Average (MA) model proves to be a more precise and dependable approach for forecasting future oil imports, enabling better decision-making for stakeholders in business strategising and enhancing profitability.

# Introduction

This project concerns a business proposal from Eagle Energy Enterprise, a prominent player in the oil refining industry known for its commitment to excellence in transforming crude oil into refined products like petrol and diesel, which power industries and households across the United States. The company’s mission is to provide reliable, high-quality energy solutions while maintaining profitability and environmental responsibility.

# Problem Statement
Eagle Energy Enterprise faces significant challenges in optimising its operations due to the volatile nature of crude oil imports into the USA. Fluctuations in import volume directly impact inventory management, production planning, and ultimately profitability. They seek to mitigate these challenges by implementing a robust forecasting system capable of accurately anticipating changes in crude oil imports.

# Rationale for the project

Enhanced decision making: Develop accurate oil import forecasts to enable Eagle Energy to make data-driven responses to market changes.
Operational Efficiency: The forecasting system will improve production planning, allowing the company to adjust operations based on expected import fluctuations.
Risk Mitigation: By predicting import variations, Eagle Energy can reduce the risk of unforeseen costs and safeguard profitability.
Improved procurement: This forecast allows better timing for purchasing crude oil, ensuring optimal pricing and inventory levels.
